# My Website!@

Welcome to the code for my [personal website](https://sohaibcs1.github.io/sohaib/))!@#

Feel free to explore, copy, or reach out with questions on how to create a similar site. There are many other resources and templates available for personal websites, such as [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/).

I built this site using Angular and hosted it on GitHub Pages. The deployment process is simpleâ€”just run `ng deploy` with the help of the [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages) tool.

## Key Features
- **Angular Framework**: A powerful, versatile framework for building single-page applications.
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting directly from your GitHub repository.
- **Easy Deployment**: Streamlined deployment process using `ng deploy`.
- **Easy Run**: Streamlined deployment process using `ng s`.
